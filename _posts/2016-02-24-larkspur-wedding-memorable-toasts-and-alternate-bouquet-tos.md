# Larkspur Wedding: Memorable Toasts and Alternate Bouquet Toss

Heather and Logan tied the knot on a sunny day in Larkspur, Colorado. An elegant outdoor ceremony exchanged vows, wove three strands into a cord to symbolize their union, and sealed their new marriage with a kiss!

At the reception, they served individual hand pies and smores at an outdoor fire pit, while guests inside swing danced and grooved to the music! They also shared their story with the guests at the reception with [their own "Our Story" video][0].

The father of the bride offered memorable marriage advice in his toast (Monday, Wednesday, Friday, twice Sunday) while the groom's brother stuck with a classic punchline in his Best Man toast.

Instead of the traditional bouquet toss, the bride decided to honor the other relationships of her guests with a unique twist. She handed out single white roses to each married man, and requested that they present the flower to their wife with a kiss -- a beautiful way to honor love and marriage!
